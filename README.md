# Cancerous Signet Ring Cell Detection
Signet ring cell carcinoma is a type of rare adenocarcinoma with poor prognosis. Early detection of such cells leads to a huge improvement in patients' survival rate. However, there is no existing public dataset with annotations for studying the problem of signet ring cell detection.

I will be following the DigestPath 2019 research challenge in MICAAIâ€™19 and focus on developing an automatic system that detects signet ring cells in histology images without the need for pathologists to detect each signet ring cell under a microscope. Manual detection like this can lead to some cells being missed out and left undetected and an automatic system would be put in place to avoid this issue. As a result, it will hopefully provide a cheaper and time-efficient way to detect signet ring cells.
